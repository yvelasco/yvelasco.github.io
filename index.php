        <h2>Course Description</h2>
            <p>
              CompSci 94 is an introductory programming course that
              teaches fundamental computer science concepts. This version of CompSci
              94 uses the tool <a href="http://www.alice.org"> Alice 3</a> to create 3-D
              virtual worlds. You will learn programming constructs such as repetition (calculating how
              many steps a person needs to walk to their car), selection (deciding which
              animal is the tallest), and organizing data (grouping penguins to waddle
              together), along with how to control objects (raise hands, flap wings,
              move, turn, spin, walk, etc.).
            </p>

            <p> This is a hands on flipped course. Before class you will watch
                videos and take an online quiz. During class we will briefly review
                the material and then you will write a program in class every day,
                working with a partner, designing 3-D virtual worlds.  Outside of
                class projects will be done alone, unless otherwise stated.
            </p>

        <h2>Required Background: NONE</h2>
            <p>No experience necessary, this is an introductory course.</p>
