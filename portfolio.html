        <p>This portfolio serves to reflect on my professional growth throughout my academic career.</p>
        <p>This portfolio functions to highlight my teaching philosophy, internship evaluations, teaching reflections, and course assignments.</p>

        <br>
      <p>I graduated from Duke University with a Master’s degree in Computer Science. As a student, I conducted research in the areas of networking, autonomous vehicles, and Vehicle-to-Vehicle technology. I have also consistently served as a student tutor or teaching assistant in technical courses. This experience allowed me to quickly identify areas where students struggle most and effectively break down complex concepts and communicate them clearly. Post-graduation, I have ventured on to teach courses at Duke University at the undergraduate level. I have also had the chance to work closely with other professors and study their teaching philosophies and how they conduct their courses. This experience has lead to a vast growth in my own teaching philosophy and a more comprehensive view of academia.</p>

      <h1>Teaching Philosophy</h1>

        <h2>Why teaching is important</h2>
      <p>Edsger W. Dijkstra, a world-renowned Computational Scientist, and philosopher once said, “Your obligation is that of active participation. You should not act as knowledge-absorbing sponges, but as whetstones on which we can all sharpen our wits”. Likewise, I strive to effectively pass on my knowledge, utilizing pedagogy, active learning techniques, and all other tools at my disposal.</p>

      <h2>Fostering a community</h2>
      <p>The classroom should be a safe, caring community where everyone is free to speak, ask questions, and even make mistakes. Mistakes are not only welcomed, but they are a necessary part of the learning process. For students who do not wish to interrupt lecture with a question, I have found that providing an anonymous back-channel during lectures helps to answer their questions comfortably.</p>

      <p>Before each new student collaboration activity, a short ice breaker effectively gets students comfortable with each other and promotes effective peer-to-peer learning. Game-based learning (i.e. Jeopardy, Hangman, or Blocky) is a fun way to create a stress-free and bonding activity while fostering course concepts. </p>

      <p>With courses of 50+ students, it becomes increasingly more challenging to create an intimate classroom environment where students feel seen by the course staff. This problem is especially true for struggling students. Early student outreach is an effective way for students to feel cared for and empowered by the course staff. </p>

      <h2>Active learning / Pedagogy</h2>
      <p>It should be clear to students why attending lecture is more beneficial than just watching a lecture recording. These benefits include engaging students through active learning techniques by interacting with one another through peer instructions (similarly, Think Pair Share) multiple times during every lecture. Continually polling the class to ensure the speed of lecture is adequate and proactively inviting questions. Occasionally I like to give students more control over what topics a lecture will cover or engage in a joint productive activity with me.  </p>

      <h2>Assessments</h2>
      <p>A varied variety of assessments are provided throughout the semester, each utilizing all aspects of Bloom’s Taxonomy. These assessments include graded and non-graded as well as solo and collaborative work. Giving students continual feedback throughout the semester empowers them to reflect on their progress and how effective their self-study habits are towards their learning. It also allows me to advise those falling behind early in the semester since I have the data to determine who they are. Likewise, students are also given the opportunity to assess my progress as an instructor for my own professional development.</p>

      <p>No student is left behind! If a student has the will to learn, I will ensure the necessary resources are in place to empower them to do just that. </p>
