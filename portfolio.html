        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>This portfolio serves to reflect on my professional growth throughout my academic career.</p>
        <p>This portfolio functions to highlight my teaching philosophy, internship evaluations, teaching reflections, and course assignments.</p>

            <p>I graduated from Duke University with a Masters degree in Computer Science. As a student, I conducted research in the areas of networking, autonomous vehicles, and Vehicle-to-Vehicle technology. I have also consistently served as a student tutor or teaching assistant in technical courses. This experience allowed me to quickly identify areas where students struggle most and effectively break down complex concepts and communicate them clearly. Post-graduation, I have ventured on to teach courses at Duke University at the undergraduate level. I have also had the chance to work closely with other professors and study their teaching philosophies and how they conduct their courses. This experience has lead to a vast growth in my own teaching philosophy and a more comprehensive view of academia.</p>

      <h1>Teaching Philosophy</h1>

        <h2>Why teaching is important</h2>
      <p>Edsger W. Dijkstra, a world-renowned Computational Scientist once said,</p>
        <blockquote>Your obligation is that of active participation. You should not act as knowledge-absorbing sponges, but as whetstones on which we can all sharpen our wits.</blockquote>
        <p>Likewise, I strive to pass on technical knowledge by utilizing pedagogy, active learning techniques, and all other tools at my disposal. I continually strive to create an effective and effecient curriculum such that no curriculum, either big or small, is without room for improvment.</p>

      <h2>Fostering a community</h2>
      <p>The classroom should be a safe, caring <a href="https://www.facultyfocus.com/articles/effective-classroom-management/a-checklist-for-building-community-in-the-college-classroom/">community</a> where everyone is free to speak, ask questions, and even make mistakes. Mistakes are not only welcomed, but they are a necessary part of the learning process. I seek to empower students to become <a href="https://www.facultyfocus.com/articles/effective-teaching-strategies/10-ways-to-promote-student-engagement/">active citizens</a> in their learning community. This extends to students who do not wish to interrupt lecture with a question, I have found that providing an anonymous back-channel during lectures helps to answer their questions comfortably.</p>

      <p>Before each new collaboration activity, a short ice breaker effectively allows students to become comfortable with one another and promotes effective <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/191029.191157">peer-to-peer learning</a>. Game-based learning (i.e. Jeopardy, Hangman, or <a href="https://blockly.games/?lang=en">Blocky</a>) creates a fun and stress-free bonding activity while fostering course concepts. </p>

      <p>Self-paced and asynchronous courses/workshops provide a unique challenge in that not all students are learning at the same pace and are separated by space and time. Offering online gatherings through video conferencing (i.e., <a href="https://www.webex.com">Cisco Webex</a>) can provide them with the needed flexibility in their schedules to work together if they elect to do so. Providing a course forum site (i.e., <a href="https://piazza.com">Piazza</a>) where students are encouraged to answer their fellow peers' questions is another engagement opportunity. The course staff can always gently correct a student response or provide a different approach altogether. Following the <a href="https://coi.athabascau.ca/coi-model/">Col model</a> as a guide for online interactions among peers has been proven to be highly effective in facilitating online learning.</p>

      <p>With courses of 50+ students, it becomes increasingly more challenging to create an intimate classroom environment where students feel seen by the course staff. This problem is especially true for struggling students. <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/newsletter/teaching/2018-08-09">Early student outreach</a> is an effective way for students to feel cared for and empowered by the course staff. </p>

      <h2>Active learning / Pedagogy</h2>
      <p>With an active learing community in place, it becomes much easier to engage students in a live lecture or workshop. It should be clear to students why attending a lecture or workshop is more beneficial than just watching a recording. These benefits include engagment through active learning techniques by interacting with one another through <a href="https://aapt.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1119/1.1474140">peer instructions</a> (similarly, Think Pair Share) multiple times during every lecture. Continually polling the class to ensure the speed of lecture is adequate and proactively inviting questions. Occasionally I like to give students more control over what topics a lecture will cover or engage in a joint productive activity with them.  </p>

      <!-- <h2>Assessments</h2> -->
      <p>A varied variety of assessments are provided throughout the semester, each utilizing all aspects of <a href="https://www.bloomstaxonomy.net">Blooms Taxonomy</a>. These assessments include graded and non-graded as well as individual and collaborative work. Giving students continual feedback throughout the semester empowers them to reflect on their progress and how effective their self-study habits are towards their learning. It also allows me to advise those falling behind early in the semester since I have the data to determine who they are. Likewise, students are also given the opportunity to assess my progress as an instructor for my own professional development.</p>

      <p>No student is left behind! If a student has the will to learn, I will ensure the necessary resources are in place to empower them to do just that. </p>
